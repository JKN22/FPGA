# FPGA
The term "field-programmable gate array" (FPGA) refers to an integrated circuit that may be customized by a user or a designer after production. A hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit, is typically used to specify the FPGA setup (ASIC). Previously, the configuration was specified using circuit diagrams, but with the development of electrical design automation tools, this is becoming less common.
